# Irish-Housing-Market-Analysis
Interactive data analysis and visual report on Ireland’s housing crisis (2012–2024) — featuring a custom-built CSO dataset, Python data processing, and a Tableau dashboard with key insights on affordability, prices, and dwelling trends.


Overview
As a student preparing to move to Ireland, I first encountered the severity of the housing crisis while searching for accommodation for myself. This personal experience sparked a deeper curiosity to investigate the Irish housing market, eventually shaping this into a data analysis project. The aim was to explore housing trends, affordability, and regional disparities using publicly available datasets and my own compiled master dataset.

- 💰 **Affordability Crisis** → In counties like Dublin and Wicklow, the average Irish worker would need nearly **11 years of gross salary** to buy a house (not inflation-adjusted).
